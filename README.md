# online-auction-system

# Introduction:
The aim of this project is to develop an online auction system for BuyMe, a company that allows users to buy and sell items through an online auction. The system will be similar to eBay, and will allow users to post items for sale, bid on items, and purchase items through the auction process.

# User Roles:
There will be two types of users in the system: buyers and sellers. Buyers will be able to search for items, place bids, and view their bidding history. Sellers will be able to post items for sale, view their auction history, and manage their listings.

# Functionality:

1. Item Listing: Sellers will be able to post items for sale by providing a description, photos, starting price, increment for bids, and a secret minimum price. They will also be able to specify the duration of the auction and any other relevant details.

2. Bidding: Buyers will be able to bid on items that are currently being auctioned. They will be able to place a bid that is higher than the current bid, and the system will automatically adjust the bid to the next increment.

3. Automatic Bidding: Buyers will be able to set a maximum bid for an item, and the system will automatically place bids on their behalf up to their maximum bid, as long as other bidders are placing bids.

4. Payment: Once the auction is complete, the buyer with the highest bid will be required to pay for the item. They will be able to make payment through the system using a secure payment gateway.

5. Feedback: Both buyers and sellers will be able to provide feedback on their experience with each other.

The online auction system for BuyMe will provide a platform for users to buy and sell items through an online auction process. The system will be developed using Python and Django web framework, and will include features such as item listing, bidding, automatic bidding, payment processing, and feedback. The system will be hosted on a cloud-based platform and will be accessible on different devices.
